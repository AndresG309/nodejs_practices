----------------------------------- SEMANTIC VERSIONING
for dependencies

X.Y.Z

X -> Major: Point when the compatibility breaks when going backwards
y -> Minor: When adding new functionalities
Z -> Patch: Fixing bugs

Remember that this is a common practice but not everyone follows it

----------------------------------- DEV dependencies
Remember to download the dependencies that are not needed for functioning, as development dependencies
for example a linter like standard: npm install standard -D
the param -D makes it a dev dependence
